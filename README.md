Terrain is modifiable using **W** for Water, **C** for Cliffs, **G** for grass
Resources are re-allocated by pressing **B** for Bananas and **O** for Oil. Press **SPACEBAR** for randomly added cliffs. The cliffs are added by a recursive function that uses a tree-like structure to create *realistic* terrain.


Click anywhere to tell the king to go there.

Have fun!
