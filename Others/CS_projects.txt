						Two potential projects:

1.  Use file parsing on Json, xml, or txt files to create a world,
	and a small adventure game.

	i. Put location data and other keys in a non-predictable way
	and build objects on different subclasses.

	ii. The data from these 'objects' is then served to map
	displayed on screen using simple gif, jpeg and Java2D assets
	to represent a world.

	iii. World is interactive : Places can be clicked and modified.
	Values are written to xml file on exit to save world.

	iv. Blank xml file does not cause IO error : it cause a blank
	world with the option to build a new xml file from scratch using
	simple options.

	v. Have a main character quest, a pathing algorithm for characters
	and (hopefully) a method to	display a subset of the full map at
	any one time to allow motion.

	Using: File IO, Java2D, XML Syntax or Json Syntax, My pathing
		   algorithm (n^2 efficiency), user input using arrowkeys
		   or mouse without console to 'immerse' player.

2.  Create a website template using objects, hierarchy, and file
	generation.

	i. Build syntax-correct html files with content sourced from
	outside files or from user input at	runtime.

	ii. Build css files that make sense : ask questions but not
	too many and generate file.

	iii. Have strong defaults for a base case.

	iv. Create an image gallery, or blog, with posts (using
	javascript to serve and alternate images & posts)

	v. Website is saved a .mywebproject file and is later
	modifiable via the args[0] of the java function	to make
	changes to document (update it for instance);

	Using: File IO, CSS syntax, HTML Syntax, Javascript Syntax
		   (simple with lots of shortcuts from Jquery), some 
		   use of Java2D to preview CSS choices (colors for
		   instance).
